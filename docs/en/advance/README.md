### Faster Loading

1. For all the users, it is the effective way to use public CDN for the third-party lib, you can add it into `static_prefix` in **theme config**ï¼›

2. You can use OSS and bind your domain, then upload the files in the folder `public` to your OSS.

3. For your custom images, especially the big banner picture, you can use [tinypng](https://tinypng.com) to compress them, and upload them to your private CDN.
